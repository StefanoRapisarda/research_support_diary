    "text": "At this point, I should say that this blog was born from a noble desire to help researchers of all disciplines or to fulfill my lifelong devotion to serving research and science in all possible forms…\nWell… no.\nThroughout my research-related roles over the past decade, I often found myself spending (investing?) considerable time on tasks and projects that rarely made it into the glorious world of peer-reviewed, published, or even recognized research outputs.\nYet, I believe there is still value—and definitely some fun—in all those hours spent on “less fortunate” projects. This blog aims to carve out a small space for that work and remind myself not to give up doing things purely out of curiosity. (By the end of this little speech, I’m already feeling a growing sense of commitment, so it is serving the purpose already)\n\nI see… but who are you?\nI’m Stefano Rapisarda: physicist, astrophysicist (PhD), postdoc-turned-research data and software consultant, data steward, Python developer, AI enthusiast, Barrel-Rider, Mother of Dragons, and so on. As a matter of fact, just an everlasting student with some technical expertise, a decent brain with short memory, and about a thousand hobbies."
